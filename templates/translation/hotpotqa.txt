### Instruction:
Translate the following natural language (NL) question and contexts to a first-order logic (FOL) rule.
Take the following NL to FOL as an example.
# Example 1:
### NL:
## Context:
If a person is a student, then he/she is a learner.
If a person is a learner, then he/she is smart.
## Question:
Is it true that a student is smart?
### FOL:
## Context:
- ∀x (student(x) → learner(x))
- ∀x (learner(x) → smart(x))
## Question:
- student(x) → smart(x)

Now, it's your turn to translate the following NL to FOL.
### NL:
## Context:
{context}
## Question:
{question}
### FOL
